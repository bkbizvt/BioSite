			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="intro">MyraBelle, or simply Belle, was the best sister, daughter, friend, and girlfriend anyone could imagine. She was also a skilled musician, exceptional student, and a loving, free-spirited, fearless individual. She was fiercely loyal, and compassionate. Belle was quick witted, funny, and intensely passionate about her beliefs. At just over 5 feet tall and barely 100 pounds, she projected a large presence. Truly, the world was a better place with her here. However, on August 4, 2018, at the age of 19, Belle was involved in a fatal motorcycle accident. This page is dedicated to my beautiful sister MyraBelle Kidder and is a memorial of her talent and the remarkable accomplishments she achieved in her amazing, yet short lifetime.
