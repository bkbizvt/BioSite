			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class="introdiv">
			<p class="introp">MyraBelle, or simply Belle, was the best sister, daughter, friend, and girlfriend anyone could imagine. She was also a skilled musician, exceptional student, and a loving, free-spirited, fearless individual. She was fiercely loyal, and compassionate. Belle was quick witted, funny, and intensely passionate about her beliefs, including being a committed Christian. At just over 5 feet tall and barely 100 pounds, she projected a large presence. Truly, the world was a better place with her here. However, on August 4, 2018, at the age of 19, Belle was involved in a fatal motorcycle accident. This page is dedicated to my beautiful sister MyraBelle Kidder and is a memorial of her talent and the remarkable accomplishments she achieved in her amazing, yet short lifetime. Use the <a class="introlink" href="#menu"> menu </a> above to navigate to specific segments of this page or just scroll through her story. Thank you for visiting!</p>

				<div class="right"><p class="pianop">The early years and her musical beginnings:  With two older brothers already being home schooled, Belle began her education at a young age. Possessing a natural ability for language, she started reading at 4 years old! She enjoyed doing her school work and was meticulous in her lessons. As part of her education, she began piano lessons at 5. This was the beginning of her varied and notable music career. Throughout the years of playing piano and perfecting her skill, Belle performed in various recitals and events, including a concert at the Town Hall Theater in Middlebury, VT to celebrate the inaugural year of the Middlebury Community Music Center in 2015. She willingly shared her talent by playing at various events; accompanying worship at church, performing background music at a Chrismas festival for children, and even providing music for weddings.<a class="toplink" href="#menu"> MENU </a></p>

			<h2>Wind Instruments</h2>
				<div class="left"><p class="windp">As she entered the 5th grade in home schooling, Belle decided to expand her music education by learning to play the flute. She contacted the Benson Village School and began instruction with the Benson Village School Band. Under the skillful guidance of Ms. Broughton and her private tutor, Kristy Papandrea, she conquered the basics quickly. In subsequent years, she continued at the Benson School and then became a member of the Fair Haven Union High School Band. She first auditioned for the Green Mountain Music Festival in 2011 and earned a place in the Middle School Wind Ensemble; then from 2012 until 2015 she played in the festival each year in the Symphonic Band. She also began playing the piccolo and earned a place with that instument in the Green Mountain Music Festival in 2016. In addition, she participated in the 2016 All State Music Festival, also playing the piccolo. Belle was a member of the Lakes Region Youth Orchestra and performed in several other music events including the Castleton University High School Honors Music Festival in 2015 and 2016, and the 2014 Northeast Instrumental Music Festival at the Lake Placid Center for the Performing Art in Lake Placid, NY.<a class="toplink" href="#menu"> MENU </a></p>
